Introduction

This Gentoo overlay is for work towards being able to use a Gentoo Linux box as
build host for Gentoo prefix running on MacOSX Tiger in a distcc environment.
The main problem is that binutils-apple cannot currently be cross-compiled due
to missing headers and other obstacles.

This overlay has also debris from earlier attempts to rectify issues and is
probably not yet useful.
